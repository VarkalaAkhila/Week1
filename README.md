# Week1
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically classify images of plastic waste. The goal is to help identify different types of plastic waste to improve recycling and waste management. The project includes steps for preparing the data, building the model, and evaluating its performance.


# Week2
The goal of this project is to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to automatically classify images of plastic waste into three categories: Biodegradable, Recyclable, and Trash. This classification model aims to help in efficient waste management and recycling by enabling automated sorting of plastic waste based on its type.
This model can assist in improving recycling processes and promoting efficient waste management by automating the sorting of plastic waste based on its type.
here deep learning model (i.e, CNN model is used, particularly CNN is used for image classification). The dataset consists three sub categories Biodegradable, Recyclable, and Trash images.
